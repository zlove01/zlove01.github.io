        <p> It was a very scary Halloween for the Utah Jazz defense as Derrick Rose set a new career
          high in scoring with 50 points. Rose shot 19/31 from the field, 4/7 from deep, and 8/11 from the
          free throw line. Outside of scoring rose had 4 rebounds, 6 assists, 1 steal, and a game winning block.
